1. Download the Hindi WordNet API and the Hindi WordNet (http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/).
2. Copy MorphIN and database directories to the HWN API (JHWNL) directory.
3. To run the java file: java cp JHWNL.jar:. Examples (on Linux). The commands to compile and run the file are present in the README.
4. To write the output to a file, modify the Examples.java file and replace the System.out.println lines with writer.write, where
writer is an instance of OutputStreamWriter. Use FileOutputStream with UTF8 encoding to open the file. Close the writer.
5. To execute these Java files from the Python code, we need to create a jar file consisting of the HWN classes and our custom classes.
6. Create a new directory next to HWN and JHWNL, let's say, Custom. Extract the JHWNL.jar into this directory.
7. Create a copy of the Examples.java file in this directory. Modify this file according to your requirement.
8. Ensure that the method is public and static.
9. Compile this file from the Custom directory (javac Examples.java).
10. Create a jar file that consists of the HWN classes and this custom class:
jar cf MyJar.jar Examples.class in/
11. Install py4j for the version of python that you are using.
12. Move this file outside the Custom directory.
13. Create the python file now.
14. Import the py4j classes for launching the gateway and using the methods in the class (Example.py).
15. Run the python file.
